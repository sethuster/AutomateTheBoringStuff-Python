# Log levels 
# logging.debug() - The lowest level. Used for small details. Usually you care about these messages only when diagnosing problems.
# logging.info() - Used to record information on general events in your program or confirm that things are working at their point in the program.
# logging.warning() - Used to indicate a potential problem that doesnâ€™t prevent the program from working but might do so in the future.
# loggin.error() - 	Used to record an error that caused the program to fail to do something.
# logging.critical() - The highest level. Used to indicate a fatal error that has caused or is about to cause the program to stop running entirely.
